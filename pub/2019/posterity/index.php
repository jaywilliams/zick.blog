<title>posterity</title>

<pre>
something that strikes me about the internet, is the
comments section. often it's my favorite part. alongside
varied works that may stand the test of time, are
these varyingly snarky, sarcastic, satirist, or serious
comments. what will our kids think about that? will it
be commonplace for ever, or could it be an artifact of a
small 20-year window. maybe old-timers will wax on about
the comments section, that they loved or hated it. maybe
it will be forgotten.
