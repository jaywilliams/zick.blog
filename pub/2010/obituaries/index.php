<h1>Obituaries</h1>

<pre>
Please by your grace let us be found
For the mold in this house is killing us now
There must be something better on this big mound
Or into death we’ll be tired and bound

The spores in the air are filling our breath
I hope you know we’ll breath to death
I shudder to think what the obituaries may say
’cause I doubt the burning chest will go away

Lord let us vanquish this enemy
Though it’s one who’s hard to see
One day I fear alone I’ll be
Unless perhaps we learn to flee
</pre>
