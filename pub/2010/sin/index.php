<h1>Causing a child to sin</h1>

<!-- this was another time for me, perhaps another me.
     although i can still remember and relate to the
     feelings, i struggle to relate to the self that
     wrote this one. b. 1.23.20 -->
<pre>
There’s an unmatched beauty
In a kiss of the first kind
That elsewhere you’ll never find
And I feel it’s my duty
To tell you: never leave yours behind
Because never again will you find
That lost first kiss

When she’s gone you’ll miss her
And all you can do is wish her
The best
That she’ll be blessed
But you’ve broke her heart
And even your own you’ve torn apart

But it’s no good
Now that you’ve understood
That you can’t marry the other you would
Because you’ve tangled with another
So you know to her father
You’ll be no good

I just wish I had another chance
To not do these things again
Because even though I’ve learned my lesson
I can never turn back to then
I just wonder how much it will lessen
My chances of finding the one He’d prepare for me
          — That blessing

Everything happens for a reason
To each thing there is a season
But what if I’ve committed high treason
To the one I was meant to lead
All because of my lusts and my greed
I’ll tell you it’ll never be as good to you thought
When it will always turn to naught

So to you who reads this remember
A wrong love will always turn to cold ember
So seek the one with the help of the father
Because your heart will deceive
And the blessings of him you must first receive
Never decide on your own
Else to pieces your heart will be blown
Lord protect her from the enemy
Which I should have known hid under the canopy
Which was making me blind so I could not see
She was never the on You had for me

So heed my words
You fairest and pure
That love is a road I’ve been down before
And even though I was hurt to the core
Watch out!
I may turn you into some kind of decaying mold spore

Yes I know the thought is sickening
But I don’t want to end up bickering
Even though I’m trying the best that I can
I may end up putting you in a frying pan
It’s happened before
And I’ll never restore
That young little girl on the fore

And I’d rather not chance ruining you
Since I fear I’m an appliance
That turns beautiful bread
Into toast of defiance

Even though for your protection I pray
Every single day
My regrets keep on seeping into my vision
And I lack the power of nuclear fission
To split the atomic nucleus away
So beside my dreams my regrets will stay
And I fear I’ll make you go astray

Because the faith in her heart was lost
And all that’s left is a pile of frost
I make a connection between myself and the loss
Because I fear it was by me her light switch was tossed
I don’t want to again make that line crossed
’Cause then a good spirit into a pan might be tossed
I just don’t want you to be lost
No matter the cost

So keep ’till your marriage that kiss
’Cause it’s definitely something you’ll miss
I hope that you’ll listen to this
’Cause you don’t want to go amiss

And be weary of me,
Who has already ruined the fruit

         of one tree
