<h1>Pretend I’m Tough</h1>

<pre>
Finally made up made my mind
In any situation you’ll find
While I’m still blind
I’ll always love your kind

I’ve found my life is so tough
All my relations so rough
I thought I had enough
but I’ve found the best thing 
            is to just pretend I’m tough

Even though you can relate
I find it’s so hard to eat what’s on my plate
So let’s sit down and contemplate
So you and I can concentrate

The problem is one you’ll find
It’s stuck right in our minds
So until our love binds
The problem will still leave us blind

The catalyst is something I insist
’cause the problem always persists
And until the gear shifts
The weights will always overlift
