<h1>Curly Fries</h1>

<pre>
Every second turns into an hour
And I find I don’t have much power
I always analyze 
      everything which I despise
Yeah all the lies 
      twist themselves like curly fries

When I neglect to tell the truth
I reject what I’m supposed to do

All my stories go untold
Or so I’m told
I might just keep them a secret as they unfold

I’ll unbury the substrate until it’s too late
To finally eat what’s on my plate
And I’ll miss dinner.
