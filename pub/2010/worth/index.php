<h1>All I’m Worth</h1>

<pre>
Honestly I just wish
I would have married before this
But I’ve already lost my last first kiss
So now all I’ve got to give
Is my second, third, fourth
But is that now all I’m worth
Some numbers they can unearth
But what about the second birth
All things become new

It just seems to me
That the things I want most
Are the things I cannot boast
Cause I know they’re what I cannot have
So maybe I need some antibiotic salve

But that wont ease the pain
So I’ll just deal
