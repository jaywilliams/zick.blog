<title>Review: Managing Humans by Michael Lopp</title>

<tag>book_review</tag>

Most of the ideas in this book are just really good
common sense. It's a great book and I recommend the whole
thing, but there were a few tidbits that really stuck
out to me. Especially the sections about certain types of
developers and their "care and feeding".

In chapter 32, nerd attention deficiency disorder (NADD)
describes a nerd condition that can be described as
information hungry, with a desire to consume various media
at once, music, video, email, blogs, podcasts, perhaps
all at once with a "transparent" context switch. In my
experience, although Michael doesn't mention this, a
nerd doesn't necessarily have to have NADD all the time,
it could be something that gets turned on and off at will
or randomly.

In chapter 38 the Free Electron is introduced. It's
possible you've met one of these, the single most
productive engineer you're ever met. From the book:
"They can do anything when it comes to code, write a
complete application from scratch, learn a new language
in the weekend, and most importantly, they can dive into
a tremendous pile of spaghetti code, make sense of it, and
actually get it working. You can build an entire business
around a free electron. They're that good."

While a free electron can be a huge benefit, they are a
strange breed and might be very different from your other
developers. To keep them truly productive, you need to

    1. Keep them engaged. Never let one get bored or they
    will just check out.

    2. Misdirected free electron energy can yield odd
    results.

    3. Free electrons sometimes will not engage and they
    wont explain why. If they don't want to do something
    they just wont. The worst case is when you ask a
    free electron to make a miracle save, they nod, and
    get right back to whatever they were doing before you
    distracted them with your dumb request. When you expect
    the miracle, and ask them, they'll just say "haven't
    gotten to that". After you've pulled your hair out,
    you realize that you didn't need a miracle miracle
    and inaction was the right move

The Fez! (chapter 41) Fez is an engineer that long ago
developed some important project for the company, that
no one else can seem to understand or maintain, but is a
crucial component for the company. Fez has long ago become
complacent thinking that he's irreplaceable. You don't
want to be Fez. Little does he know some other developers
already have re-developed his masterpiece so others can
maintain it, and soon there will be no reason to keep
Fez around.
