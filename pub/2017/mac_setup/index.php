<title>my setup - august 2017</title>

<tag>notes</tag>

<pre>
every once in a while, i audit my entire tech rig to see
what i'm doing, and go over things i can make better,
simplify, or remove completely. from my stack of apps and
software, to my config

what i'm running on right now: a refurbished 11" macbook
air from 2012 i call "totoro". it's named after my ibook
g4 from '06, which was called "toto". (that was the first
laptop i owned that i actually liked.) i bought it to
prepare for my europe trip, to replace a dying 2011 i have
used to death, cracked the screen and the trackpad pretty
bad, and can only use it hooked up to an external screen.
i have mostly used a desk-bound mac mini for work, so i'm
making these notes as i get everything on my air ready
for full-time use.

most of my list is focused on making a great portable rig,
since i want to travel way more.


<strong>things i'm replacing / removing</strong>

with built-in apps (or just removing altogether):

- chrome --> safari (faster / more performant)
- f.lux  --> night shift (built in to macOS)
- alfred --> spotlight (i was using it because it's
  indexing works great on HDDs, on an SSD spotlight is
  amazing)
- itsycal (don't need it because Calendar.app opens very
  quickly on SSD)
- webcam settings app (built-in iSight works great without,
  since i'm on the air now)
- magic prefs (don't need it on macbook with the trackpad)

with other applications:

- bartender --> vanilla (vanilla is much simpler and more
  performant. the idea is to make the menubar actually more
  minimal, and this helps with that)
- amethyst  --> moom (why: amethyst reflows slowly, and
  confuses my wife whenever she uses my computer)


<strong>still working on</strong>

- auto-upload screenshots for chatting (replacing an
  alfred script)
- hipchat app (replacing with either profanity.im, adium,
  or messages)
- replacing mail + mailbutler with something more light
  weight (terminal utilities)
- terminal / iterm / hyper (would like to use something
  like st, drawterm, or alacritty)


<strong>things i'm keeping around (only resilio runs constantly)</strong>

- resilio sync (let's me sync between my own backup server,
  computers, and iphones)
- spotify (music is essential)
- private internet access (might like to use built-in L2TP
  instead of PIA app)
- transmit for ftp
- db clients: sequel pro, robo3t, postico
- old standbys: taco html edit, coteditor, coderunner,
  notational velocity


<strong>things i'm testing out</strong>

- <a href=http://pkgsrc.joyent.com/install-on-osx/>pkgsrc</a> to install the below.
  i've had limited success with macports, and even less
  success with homebrew. nix has worked for me, and
  although i really like the concept of how it works,
  the things or versions of things i was want aren't in
  the repository, and the interface is a bit annoying
- profanity.im for chat
- mutt (<a href=/2017/terminal_email>etc</a>) for email
- also using it to install these cli utilities i use all
  the time: tmux, mosh, fish

<strong>physical things</strong>

- keyboard: since i'm on a laptop, i don't need my
  mechanical keyboard (but to be honest i love typing on it
  much more than any macbook i've used. would love a laptop
  with a mechanical keyboard)
- earphones: was using koss portapro, switched to the very
  durable shure se215 - i've never really liked earbuds,
  but i'm glad i gave these a try. they remove most of the
  issues i have with them, and they are way quieter since as
  earbuds they block external sounds. i think other similarly
  priced earbuds may be about as good
- got rid of podcasting mic (works amazing for conference
  calls), and instead use a mic built-in to the shure
  heavy-duty cable i bought


<strong>adobe software...</strong> (sigh)

although i've used adobe software for many years, i've
slowly been replacing it with other things (although i
often open the adobe product when i need to get something
specific done very quickly, because muscle memory). the
latest versions are so slow, run so many daemons in the bg,
and they want to just push their cloud on you

* adobe illustrator --> affinity designer
* adobe photoshop   --> acorn


i've also been trying to experiment with the ideas in this
post, <a href=https://marco.org/2018/07/31/mac-low-power-mode>Low Power Mode</a>, because it will enhance my ability
to travel by squeezing more out of the battery

hope you found this entertaining or it gives you some
ideas for your own rig
