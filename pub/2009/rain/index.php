<h1>Rain</h1>

<pre>
Rain falling, falling
Her tears fall down
Even the skies cry out from her sadness
The pain inside
Manifests quietly in her sobs
She rejects everything she knows
Because she feels unloved, neglected
The rain falls
Soaking through her skin
Numbing her heart

How long will it be
Before sheâ€™s gone
Her tears no more
</pre>
