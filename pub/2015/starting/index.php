<title>Command line, Git, and troubleshooting for beginners</title> <tag>programming</tag> <tag>bookmarks</tag>

<h2 id="linux-un-x-command-line">Linux/UN*X Command Line</h2>
<p>Start with <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/">LinuxCommand.org</a>.</p>
<p>A good cheatsheet will go a long way. Google is your friend. One great option is <a href="https://github.com/kevinthew/linuxgems/blob/master/cheat_sheet.org.sh">&quot;Linux Gems&quot;</a>, try going through and learning about each one.</p>
<p>If you know DOS at all, <a href="http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/unix_for_dos_users.html">Linux for DOS users</a> might help. (It also works in reverse if you know Linux and you&#39;re trying to survive on Windows.)</p>
<p>When you don&#39;t know what a command means, a nifty little utility called <a href="http://www.explainshell.com/">Explain Shell</a> can help, and from there you can read the <code>man</code> or <code>info</code> pages to glean more.</p>
<p>For book people, I recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2nlUnPH">The Linux Command Line</a> by William Shotts, from No Starch Press.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Start with <a href="https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">try.github.io</a></p>
<p>Once you feel comfortable and would like to move on to some more meatier Git concepts, try <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">Atlassian Git Tutorials</a> where you will become a Git Guru.</p>
<p><a href="https://guides.github.com/">GitHub Guides</a> are really great for getting you used to the flow of Git and how to really start contributing to projects.</p>
<p>For a fuller understanding, the best thing to do next is simply read <a href="http://git-scm.com/">the GIT manual</a></p>
<p>If you&#39;re having trouble along the way, <a href="http://ricardofilipe.com/projects/firstaidgit/">First Aid Git</a> may be able to help you out.</p>

<h2 id="troubleshooting-and-learning">Troubleshooting and Learning</h2>
<p>To learn when and what type of questions to ask, when you are looking for help, see <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/what-have-you-tried/">What have you tried?</a></p>
<p>Being able to troubleshoot problems quickly is a very important skill. There is a process you can use to help you troubleshoot quickly, even if you don&#39;t know a lot of details about what you are trying to fix. Steve Litt explains this in <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/bookstore/tsjustfacts.htm">Troubleshooting: Just the Facts</a>. The website isn&#39;t anything flashy or impressive, but the information is a gem.</p>
<p>Also by Steve Litt, <a href="http://www.troubleshooters.com/bookstore/rl21.htm">Rapid Learning for the 21st Century</a> can helping you to accelerate learning anything, by using a structured self-learning approach. <a href="http://amzn.to/2mAzTUw">The First 20 Hours</a> by Josh Kaufman is another resource in this area.</p>
