i had to watch that a few times
itâ€™s both oddly satisfying and a bit disconcerting
but the excitement of it!
i almost want to fix some code in production now for the endorphins
...could die of a heart attack in the process, but it would be worth it

http://zick.blog/2018/revisit/ instead of <co> would <cite> be more semantic?

Listing: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dir

also todo:

[x] actually allow subset of html in comments
[x] list posts on main page sorted by actual date
[x] tag listing
[x] word search on posts
[x] don't use cookies anymore
[x] use same sort order on tag and directory listing as index
[x] atom / json feeds
[x] test it all in mobile, make sure it displays acceptably
[x] make a 'pub' folder that all public stuff is kept it
[x] make a git repo for all my posts so they are safe and backed up on gh
[x] add darkmode
[ ] use same stylesheet for comments page as well
[ ] make inputs behave on ios

[ ] make comment form message me
[ ] comment edit/delete
[ ] make comment list escape html in a much smarter way (probably, actually parse & lint the allowed syntax)
[ ] make comment list escape urls in a smarter way -- escaping any characters except a whitelist htmlentities($x,ENT_QUOTES), only allowing http(s) through parse_url
[ ] syntax highlighting?
